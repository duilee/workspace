    "\"All models are wrong. Some are useful.\" This trenchant assessment of modeling is attributed to the British statistician [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box) and has been the subject of [much discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).\n",

    "Keep that in mind as you skim this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665405/) in a 2016 issue of [The American Statistician](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1200484#.XKWnbutKgyd), a publication of [The American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/). It includes the use of the homogeneous Poisson process to model times of earthquakes in California. It's not surprising that the model might be an over-simplification; see for example this [lecture](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Seminars/psu10.pdf) by Prof. [Philip Stark](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) of Berkeley's Statistics department. However, it's OK as a rough starting point, and you can use it to make some rough predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data used in the paper. The table `quakes` consists of data on all earthquakes in California of magnitude 4.9 or greater, between January 1857 and August 2014. There were 51 such quakes. Of course there were smaller earthquakes too, but those are not part of the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In what follows, the word \"quake\" means \"earthquake of magnitude 4.9 or more\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Magnitude` is a measure of the strength of an earthquake, and `MMI` stands for the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale that measures the intensity of shaking.\n",
    "\n",
