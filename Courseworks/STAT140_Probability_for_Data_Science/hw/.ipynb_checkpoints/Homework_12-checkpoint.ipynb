The 2017 SAT had two parts: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (ERW) and Math. It is generally believed that the joint distribution of ERW and Math scores of test-takers in any given year is roughly bivariate normal. This can only be a rough approximation because SAT scores aren't continuous variables. But let's make a lazy choice for this exercise: pretend that SAT scores are continuous and that the approximation is exact.\n",
