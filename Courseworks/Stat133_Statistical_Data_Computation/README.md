## STAT133 Fall 2018

### Course Description

__Stat 133: Concepts in Computing with Data__ is an introductory course to computational 
data analysis using the statistical programming language __R__ (and other computational tools)
with an emphasis on five major cornerstones:

- Data Manipulation (wrangling, reshaping, tidying)
- Data Visualization (focus on statistical charts)
- Programming Concepts (with emphasis on data analysis)
- Data Technologies (various sources/formats of data)
- Reporting Tools (via dynamic documents)

Because Stat 133 is one of the core courses of the Statistics Department,
the underlying goal is to provide foundations for "computing with data" so 
statistics-major students have the basic computational skills for subsequent 
upper division courses (e.g. Stat 150, 151A, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159).
This involves teaching students how to:

- understand common data formats
- use the computer extensively to conduct statistical analysis of data.
- use existing software rather than build routines from the ground up.
- understand how to visualize data and display statistical information
- learn the basic principles for writing code
- organize your workflow
- focus on aspects of computing to conduct data analysis, NOT the 
computational aspects of statistical methods
- use computational tools to carry out the data analysis cycle
