## Purpose

From the logistical point of view, the purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand, I will work with data.frames/tibbles and producing plots but now using the packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2". On the other hand, I will start working with a more complexﬁlestructure. Moreover,insteadofsubmittingacomboof Rmd-htmlﬁlestobCourses, you will have to upload all the ﬁles to your Github Classroom Repository.

## Motivation

In this assignment, I am going to consider diﬀerent ways to rank the NBA teams. From simple rankings based on a given observed variable, to rankings based on derived indices like eﬃciency (i.e. EFF) or any other composite index. To make things more interesting, let’s pretend that the NBA does not work the way it does. Let’s also pretend that the only available data is the player statistics, and nothing else. In other words, we don’t know the number of wins (and losses) of each team, or which team won the championship. Moreover, let’s assume there is no such championship. All we have is the information about the players, and the goal is to ﬁnd a ranking for the teams.
