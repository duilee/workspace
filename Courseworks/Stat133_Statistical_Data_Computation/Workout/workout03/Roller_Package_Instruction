## Rolling a device

The package '"roller"' is package for simulating rolling a device a given number of times.
One can create own device with customized sides and probability, and can simulate rolling
for desired number of times. Visualization of rolls is also available. 

## Creating a device

To create a device, use the function 'coin()'

> demodev <- device()

By default, device will create a device with side 1 and 2 and with 0.5 probability for each. 
To create your own device, you need to specify the sides and probabilties with following,
- sides has at least 2 elemens
- sides has no duplicate
- probabilities all have value between 0 and 1
- probabilities add up to one

More device examples,

> #Regular dice
> dice <- device(sides = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), prob = rep(1/6, 6))
>
> #Regular coin
> coin <- device(sides = c('head', 'tail'), prob = rep(1/2, 2))
>
> #Unfair coin
> unfaircoin <- device(sides = c('head', 'tail'), prob = c(0.2, 0.8))

Calling the object 'dice', you will get

> dice
object "device"

  side      prob
1    1 0.1666667
2    2 0.1666667
3    3 0.1666667
4    4 0.1666667
5    5 0.1666667
6    6 0.1666667

## Rolling the device

To roll your device, use 'roll()', with your designated device in the input. 

> roll(demodev)

By default, 'roll()' will your roll your device once and return the result.
You can specify the number of times you want to roll your device,
by specifying 'times'

> demoroll <- roll(demodev, times = 10)
> demoroll
object "rolls"

 [1] 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1

You can also explore related information of your roll result.

- use 'rolls' to extract the rolls result only
> demoroll$rolls
 [1] 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1

- use 'sides' to examine the sides of given device

> demoroll$sides
 [1] 1 2

- use 'prob' to examine the probability of each side

> demoroll$prob
[1] 0.5 0.5

- use 'total' to figure out total number of rolls

> demoroll$total
[1] 10

## Summary Method for object 'rolls'

- Summary method can be used by 'summary()' with rolls object as input

> summary(demoroll)
summary "rolls"

  side count prop
1    1     4  0.4
2    2     6  0.6

Symmary will provide a datafram containing 3 columns of 'side', 'count' and 'prop'. 
- side : the sides of the rolled device
- count : the frequency(count) of each side of the rolled device
- prop : the relative frequency(proportion) of each side of the rolled device

The dataframe can be accessed by using 'freqs'

> demosummary <- summary(demoroll)
> demosummary$freqs
  side count prop
1    1     4  0.4
2    2     6  0.6

## Plot Method for object 'rolls'

The plot method for object 'rolls' can be used with function 'plot()' with 'rolls' object as input

> plot(demoroll)

'plot()' will return a barchart of proportions

## Addtional Methods

- An extraction method to extract the value of a given roll, following regular r indexing

> demoroll[2]
[1] 2

- A replacement method to replace the value of a given roll also follows regular r indexing

> demoroll[2] <- 1
> demoroll[2]
[1] 1

- an addition method will add more roll, i.e to add 10 more rolls,

> demoroll + 10
object "rolls"

 [1] 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2
